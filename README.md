# Magical Chest

## Overview

This is a mod for the game of Don't Starve Together which is available in the Steam Workshop. 

This is a magical chest which can do plenty of things.

The chest can be built at Structure tab and require the second magical tech, whose recipe is two purple gem, four livinglogs and six nightmarefuels.

The mod will develop into a great trade system gradually. Guys, I need your encouragement. Tell me I am not alone.

There are two series of buttons beside the chest slots.

The buttons under the slots are `Respawn`, `Sell`, `Sacrifice`, `Recycle`, `Display`, `Store` and `Withdraw`. 

- Respawn will drop everything and respawn the player who click the button and have a Telltale Heart in the inventory, which means player can reselect the character. The process will consume a Telltale Heart in the player's inventory.
- Sell can sell many things for goldnuggets.
- Sacrifice will give you 5 goldnuggets at the cost of 50 health and 50 sanity. When player's health or sanity is not more than 50, the function will be disabled.
- Recycle will destroy anything in the chest, which is made for dealing with the trash. Be aware, do not recycle unique things, such as chester eyebone.
- Display will display the number of the gold nuggets that are stored in the Magical Chest.
- Store will store the gold nuggets that are put into the Magical Chest.
- Withdraw will withdraw the gold nuggets that are stored before. Every click will withdraw 20 gold nuggets. The insterest of gold nuggets is configurable. The default insterest is 1% per day.
